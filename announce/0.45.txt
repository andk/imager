Imager 0.45 has been released and will soon be available on all CPAN
mirrors.

This is primarily a bug-fix release.  The following issues have been
fixed:

- the dynamic filters Makefile would fail after everything had been
  built on Win32

- the correct error messages are now produced for Freetype 2.0 errors

- multiple master fonts are now supported by the freetype 2 driver

- we now attempt to use freetype-config and pkg-config when probing
  for and configuring freetype 2.

- we now attempt to use pkg-config when probing for and configuring
  libpng

- we don't accept a directory indicating freetype 2.x headers as a
  freetype 1.x installation any more

- reading a TGA image with a long (>127) idstring would result in an
  allocation error.

- calling the read() method for a format supported by Imager but not
  supported by the current build (eg. reading a JPEG without libjpeg
  installed when Imager was built) no longer crashes with an undefined
  function error.

- the i_glin() XS code wasn't copying the returned colors back correctly

- the right-side bearing calculated for freetype2.x wasn't scaled from
  a fixed point number to an integer, this would cause pos_width() to
  be much luarger than was correct if the right-most character
  overflowed the character box.

- saving a gradient file with Imager::Fountain->save() missed
  outputting a space between the last 2 parameters of each segment.

- methods that work with an image and return a new image now warn when
  called in void context.

- the Imager::Matrix2d rotate() method would only use the x and y
  parameters if both were non-zero.

- the FT1.x driver ignored the align parameter.

Documentation changes:

- added a concept index for perldoc Imager

- more examples in Imager::Draw

- added examples to all filters in Imager::Filter

- many minor documentation fixes

New/improved features:

- Imager::Fountain can read newer GIMP gradient files containing NAME
  lines

- color names can now be used where color objects were required for
  most filters.

- all font drivers now return an display_width() and right_bearing()
  value.
