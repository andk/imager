This directory includes example code for Imager.

If you have sample code to contribute, please contact the maintainer.

The notes here just provide a basic description and the functions
used.

anaglyph.pl

  Produce a color, grey or pure anaglyph image given left and right
  images of a stereoscopic pair.

  Uses transform2() and convert().

interleave.pl

  Produce an interleaved image given the left and right images of a
  stereoscopic pair.  Note that the source images must be pre-scaled.

  This includes 3 different implementations, first using transform2(),
  the second using the internal i_copyto() function and the third using
  the internal i_glin() and i_plin() functions.
