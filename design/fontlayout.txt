<sky:#imager> TonyC: I want to add support for advanced font layouting
<sky:#imager> like photoshop has
<sheriff_p:#perl> crab - was that to me/
<TonyC:#imager> define "advanced font layouting" - what I remember of photoshop
           it wasn't too great
<sky:#imager> ok, like quarexpress
<sky:#imager> kerning, spacing, alignment
<TonyC:#imager> I've considered doing spacing
<TonyC:#imager> alignment as in left/right/centre/filled?
